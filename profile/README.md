# Augment Vision - Scaling the future of video AI

We guide advanced computer vision and AI models from experimentation to enterprise-scale deployment — building reliable, high-performance systems that accelerate innovation and generate real-world impact across industries.

> A machine learning model that cannot be integrated at scale, is just a model that nobody can use.

At Augment Vision we are bringing machine learning for vision to life by implementing tools to scale a video network of ip cameras, applying MLOps best pratices to scale machine learning models through `Kubernetes` and `Docker` and making models interactive through custom user interfaces and industry specific use cases. 

## Our products

### Agent, Factory, Vault and Hub

Augment Vision comes with a range of solutions helping you to setup a small video surveillance deployment flawlessly, with just a few cameras, and scale out to a large enterprise deployment, with thousands of cameras. It provides features to bring your own cloud (on-premise, hybrid, cloud), bring your own storage (Ceph, Minio, GCP, AWS, Azure, Storj, etc) and bring your own cameras (RTSP H264 and H265). In other words, you run the show!
