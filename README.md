# Welcome to uug.ai

Cool, you are building vision models! But can you deploy ðŸ“¦ and scale ðŸš€ them?
You are not alone. Together with uug, we scale machine learning models and computer vision algorithms to transform vision into innovative and impactful solutions, enriching lives and industries.

## Our products

### Kerberos.io
 Within Kerberos.io we support containerisation and scalability by default. This means that any solution you'll find in our solution stack is shipped as a container natively and on the platform you desire: Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, OpenShift or as a static binary through various package manager such as Snap. You might also deploy our [Kerberos Agent](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent) directly on your camera to avoid deploying additional hardware.

Each component in the Kerberos.io architecture can be installed how and where you want. This means you can create hybrid scenarios, or go for a full-cloud or full-onpremise deployment.

- [Kerberos Agent](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent)
- [Kerberos Factory](https://github.com/kerberos-io/factory)
- [Kerberos Vault](https://github.com/kerberos-io/vault)
- [Kerberos Hub](https://github.com/kerberos-io/hub)

As you might expect, we are continuously working on the next innovations, [follow our current work and future plans on our roadmap](https://github.com/kerberos-io/roadmap/projects/2).

### Facial Access Control
We have build an open source product that relies on various face recognition models, and embedded it into a feature rich web application that allows an organisation to safely add and store biometric data and provide access to various tools and rooms through API's, IoT or IO devices. To deploy the model into a production environment, you might want to combine this with Kerberos.io to provide to scale.
