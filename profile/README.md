# Welcome to uugment

Cool, you are building vision models! But can you deploy ðŸ“¦ and scale ðŸš€ them? You are not alone. At UUG.AI we scale machine learning models and computer vision algorithms to transform vision into innovative and impactful solutions, enriching lives and industries.

At UUG.AI we are bringing machine learning for vision to life by implementing tools such as Insight `previously know as kerberos.io` to scale a video network of ip cameras, applying MLOps best pratices to scale machine learning models through `kubernetes` and `docker` and making models interactive through custom user interfaces and industry specific use cases (e.g. `facial access control`). In the end a machine learning model without a UI, that cannot scale, is just a model that nobody can use.

## Our products

### Insight

Insight comes with a range of solutions helping you to setup a small video surveillance deployment flawlessly, with just a few cameras, and scale out to a large enterprise deployment, with thousands of cameras. It provides features to bring your own cloud (on-premise, hybrid, cloud), bring your own storage (Ceph, Minio, GCP, AWS, Azure, Storj, etc) and bring your own cameras (RTSP H264 and H265). In other words, you run the show!
